# NewsApp
Using React JS Function Based Components



As part of my learning journey in ReactJS, I have built my second react app named The News App that uses the News API to fetch news articles from various categories, such as business, entertainment, health, sports, general, science and technology news. The app also has different pages for each category, and it uses infinite scroll to load more articles as the user scrolls down.

I built this app to learn more about ReactJS and to practice my front-end development skills. I am proud of the way the app turned out, and I believe it is a valuable tool for anyone who wants to stay up-to-date on the latest news.

Here I have attached a short video which demonstrates this NewsApp.
